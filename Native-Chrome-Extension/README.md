# Chrome Extension [Deprecated]

Well, you shouldn't be here...

This is a native chrome extension which I wrote. It relies on jQuery and uses the Github API to find the size of a repo (both of these things have been improved in the Userscript.)

Google has blocked sideloading of extensions in Chrome, so there is nothing you can do with this thing, but I'm still keeping it here because I don't feel like deleting it.

You really should press the backspace button now.
